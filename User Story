As a customer, I want to be able to search for and book a rental car through an online platform, so that I can easily compare prices and availability from different car rental companies and reserve a car that meets my needs.

I want to be able to specify my rental dates and location, and see a list of available cars and their prices from different car rental companies. I want to be able to select a car and make a reservation, and receive a confirmation of my booking.

I want to be able to pay for my rental through the online platform, and receive a receipt for my payment.

When I arrive at the car rental location to pick up my car, I want to be able to easily identify and locate my rental car, and have a smooth and efficient check-in process.

At the end of my rental period, I want to be able to return the car to the car rental company and receive an itemized list of any charges for damages or additional services.
